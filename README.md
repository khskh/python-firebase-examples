# Firebase python examples
Some of python scripts for Firebase divided into two groups; local and server-side. All local scripts are intended
to use on your pc, while server-side functions are ready-to-use functions to implement them as Firebase Functions.

Most functions require the installation of the firebase-admin library to work correctly. 
You can install it by following the command:

```
pip install firebase-admin
```

For individual scripts, more information can be found in the requirements.txt files.

The detailed description of the usage can be found in the comments within the script
